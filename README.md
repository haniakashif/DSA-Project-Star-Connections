# DSA-Project-Star-Connections
This is the repo containing our code for our DSA Spring 23 Project

The code shows the shortest connection between 2 actors who have some relation costarring with others.
The user inputs the names of both actors in the required field making sure they are spelled correctly with proper capitalization.
Pressing the "find connection" button will either display a graph if the connection exists or a related error message.
Pressing "esc" will terminate the code.
